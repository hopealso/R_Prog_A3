# R_Prog_A3
Johns Hopkins / Coursera R Programming Assignment 3

This project satisfies, in part, the requirements of Assignment 3 from
the R Programming Course of the Johns Hopkins University 
Specialization in Data Science hosted on Coursera.org.

The best, rankhospital, and rankall functions provide answers to queries 
against data found at the the Hospital Compare web site 
(http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Dept of Health and 
Human Services. The data provides information about the quality of care 
at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S.

Prior to calling these functions, the files hospital-data.csv
and outcome-of-care-measures.csv must be downloaded into the R working
directory.
